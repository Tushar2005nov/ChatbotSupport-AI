# ChatbotSupport-AI

I've created a simple chatbot with the following features:

Basic conversation handling
Response memory with JSON storage
Knowledge base for common queries
Greeting and farewell detection
Conversation history tracking

To interact with the chatbot:

Type your messages and press Enter
Ask about products, business hours, or contact information
Type 'exit' to end the conversation
The chat history is automatically saved to chat_history.json for future reference.

Note: Since we're limited to Python's standard library, this is a basic implementation.
